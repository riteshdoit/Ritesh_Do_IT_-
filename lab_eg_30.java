30 .All the banks operating in India are controlled by RBI. RBI has set a well defined guideline (e.g.       minimum interest rate, minimum balance allowed, maximum withdrawal limit etc) which all banks must   follow. For example, suppose RBI has set minimum interest rate applicable to a saving bank account to be 4% annually; however, banks are free to use 4% interest rate or to set any rates above it. 
Write a JAVA program to implement bank functionality in the above scenario and demonstrate the dynamic polymorphism concept. Note: Create few classes namely Customer, Account, RBI (Base Class) and few derived classes (SBI, ICICI, PNB etc). Assume and implement required member variables and functions in each class.
Hint: Class Customer {
 //Personal Details ... // Few functions ... 
} 
Class Account { 
// Account Detail ... // Few functions ...
 } 
Class RBI { Customer c; //hasA relationship Account a;
 //hasA relationship .. 
Public double GetInterestRate() { }
 Public double GetWithdrawalLimit() { }
 } 
Class SBI: public RBI {
 //Use RBI functionality or define own functionality. 
} 
Class ICICI: public RBI { //Use RBI functionality or define own functionality. }
